 Strategic Insights & Recommendations
- Festive calendar drives revenue: November (Diwali/Raksha Bandhan), February (Valentine’s), and March (Holi) are critical months — prioritize inventory, marketing, and promotions during these periods.
- Evening ordering behavior: Run targeted ads, flash sales, and push notifications between 6–9 PM for maximum impact.
- Soft toys & gift sets dominate: Increase focus on bundled/complete gift offerings; consider creating more occasion-specific combos.
- Geographic concentration: Strengthen logistics and marketing in Gujarat and Rajasthan — these regions show the highest order density.
- Average delivery ~5.5 days: Aim to reduce to 3–4 days during peak festive seasons to improve customer satisfaction.

This dashboard clearly demonstrates that occasion-based gifting, evening purchase behavior, and festive seasonality are the primary drivers of ABC Company’s 2022 performance.
